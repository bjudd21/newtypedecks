# Clarifying Questions for Gundam Card Game Website PRD

## 1. Problem/Goal
**A)** What specific problem does this website solve for Gundam Card Game players? I want to create the easiest to use card database/deckbuilding website, that also runs very smoothly in browser and mobile both. The official website has a database and its okay to use but not great. There are other websites like exburst.dev/gundam and gundams.dev but they are clunky and unappealing.
**B)** Is the main goal to create a better alternative to the official gundam-gcg.com site? I want a one stop shop for both the card database and where players can do their own deckbuilding.
**C)** Are you looking to serve competitive players, casual players, or both? both.

## 2. Target User
**A)** Who is your primary user? Competitive, casual, and new players.
**B)** What's their typical experience level with the Gundam Card Game? Brand new to 3 months of experience with the game. The game is brand new so I want something that will be appealing for players to go to and make decks and check cards. 
**C)** Do they primarily play online, in-person, or both? Both

## 3. Core Functionality - Card Database
**A)** What specific card information should be searchable/filterable? The Name, Level, Cost, and all other meta data on a card. Ask me to provide a sample card image for you to review and generate this info when you read this.
**B)** Should users be able to view card images in high resolution? Yes, I want the cleanest looking cards that look both professional in browser and on mobile. The user experience is extremely important.
**C)** Do you want card pricing/market data integration? Eventually, does not need to be right away.
**D)** Should there be card rulings or official text explanations? absolutely. those can also be found on a per card basis from gundam-gcg.com/en/cards on each individual card.

## 4. Core Functionality - Deck Building
**A)** What deck building features are most important? Drag and Drop into Categories defined by card type, and also custom categories. Search and add with predictive suggestions as the user is typing the card name.
**B)** Should users be able to save/share decks publicly? Yes
**C)** Do you want deck statistics (mana curve, card type distribution, etc.)? Yes
**D)** Should there be deck import/export functionality? Yes

## 5. User Stories
Could you provide 2-3 specific user stories? For example:
- "As a competitive player, I want to quickly find all cards with specific keywords so I can build optimized decks"
- "As a new player, I want to see deck examples so I can learn the game"
- "As a player I want to be able to sahre my deckbuilds with my friends in our group chats"
- "As a player I want to be able to export my deckbuilds to text format so I can import them into other online tools and play with those decks."
- "As a player I want a place where I can keep a list of the decks I've built for easy reference"

## 6. Data Requirements
**A)** Do you have access to official card data, or will this need to be manually entered? We have access to official card data at gundam-gcg.com/en/cards. Or if needed we can screen scrape, or I can manually take screenshots of cards.
**B)** Should the site pull data from gundam-gcg.com or maintain its own database? It should pull data into our own database to maintain.
**C)** Do you need real-time card availability/pricing data? Not for MVP.

## 7. Design/UI Preferences
**A)** Do you want to match the Gundam aesthetic (colors, fonts, styling)? Yes, but make sure its different enough that Im not infringing on any potential legal issues. Also make sure The owners of the cards game are properly credited for any material that is copyrighted. 
**B)** Should it be mobile-responsive for phone/tablet use? Yes. 
**C)** Any specific layout preferences beyond the Scryfall/Moxfield inspiration? No, and if you can improve upon those designs, I'm welcome to suggestions.

## 8. Technical Considerations
**A)** Do you have a preferred technology stack? (React, Vue, etc.) You suggest it to me. 
**B)** Should this be a single-page application or multi-page? Whatever you think is best.
**C)** Do you need user accounts/authentication? I think so, if users are going to be able to save their deck builds, they probably need to be able to make accounts right? 

## 9. Scope/Boundaries
**A)** Should this include tournament tracking or just deck building? Both
**B)** Do you want social features (comments, ratings, etc.)? After MVP.
**C)** Any features you definitely DON'T want to include? Not that I can think of right now.
