Card Data Source: What is the most reliable method for obtaining and maintaining up-to-date card data from the official source? gundam-gcg.com/en/cards on the offical site.

There should be footers on webpages where necessary to make clear that the images and text on teh website are copyrighted by the owner, and that the website is not produced, or endorsed, or affliated in any way with the copyright holders. Along with any other relevant information you think may be ncessary.
