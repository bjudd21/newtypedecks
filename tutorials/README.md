## Contributing

When adding new tutorials:

1. Use clear, descriptive filenames
2. Include a table of contents for longer documents
3. Add the tutorial to this README with a brief description
4. Include code examples and screenshots where helpful
5. Keep tutorials focused on "how-to" rather than "what is"
6. Maintain purple theme consistency in all examples
7. Use component names instead of line numbers when possible
