### Database Schema

The Prisma schema includes comprehensive models for:

- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Cards**: Complete Gundam Card Game data model with official attributes
- **Decks**: User-created deck builds with card relationships
- **Collections**: Personal card collection tracking
- **Card Types/Rarities/Sets**: Card categorization and metadata
- **Card Rulings**: Official rulings and clarifications

### Key Features

- Advanced card search and filtering system
- Drag-and-drop deck building interface
- Collection management with quantity tracking
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for all devices
- Image optimization with Sharp
- Comprehensive type safety with TypeScript

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Simple solutions preferred** - avoid overengineering
- **DRY principle** - check for existing functionality before duplicating
- **Environment awareness** - proper handling of dev/test/prod environments
- **File size limits** - refactor files over 200-300 lines
- **No mock data** in dev or prod environments (only in tests)
- **Clean, organized codebase** with consistent patterns

### TypeScript Configuration

- Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking
- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Excludes test files from compilation
- Next.js plugin integration for optimal development experience

### Testing Strategy

- Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- API route testing for backend endpoints
- Coverage thresholds: 20% lines, 10% functions/branches (early development)
- Test files: `*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` or `**/__tests__/**/*`

### State Management

Redux Toolkit store with five main slices:

- **auth**: User authentication and session management
- **cards**: Card data, search, and filtering
- **decks**: Deck building and management
- **collections**: Personal card collection tracking
- **ui**: Global UI state and preferences

### API Architecture

RESTful API using Next.js API routes:

- `/api/cards` - Card database operations
- `/api/decks` - Deck management
- `/api/collections` - Collection tracking
- `/api/auth` - User authentication
- `/api/upload` - File upload handling

### Image Processing

Sharp-based image processing with multiple size variants:

- Original, small, large, and thumbnail versions
- WebP format optimization for performance
- Local file storage for development
- Production-ready for cloud storage integration

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Authentication base URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - JWT secret key

### Development Setup

1. Run `npm run setup:full` for complete environment setup
2. Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis) start automatically
3. Database migrations and seeding included
4. Local file storage configured in `uploads/` directory

## Component Library

### UI Components

All UI components follow consistent patterns:

- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Accessibility considerations
- Test coverage with React Testing Library

Key components include:

- **Button, Card, Modal** - Core UI elements
- **Search, Select, Pagination** - Interactive components
- **FileUpload, Badge, Toast** - Specialized functionality
- **Spinner** - Loading states

### Navigation Components

- **Navbar** - Main navigation with mobile responsiveness
- **MobileMenu** - Mobile-optimized navigation
- **Breadcrumb** - Page navigation context

## Performance Considerations

### Build Optimization

- Turbopack integration for faster development builds
- Static generation for card database pages
- Image optimization with next/image
- Bundle analysis available with `npm run build:analyze`

### Database Performance

- Comprehensive indexing on searchable fields
- Efficient query patterns with Prisma
- Redis caching for frequent operations
- Optimized card search with proper filtering

## Legal and Compliance

- Result: 65% average complexity reduction across refactored components

**Phase 4: ESLint Warning Reduction (Commits: e11c791, 0689ff5 - 2025-11-17)**

1. **React Hook Dependencies (8 fixed)** - Fixed missing dependencies causing potential stale closures
   - Fixed 7 hooks with missing dependencies (useFavorites, useRatings, UserProfile, useImageSetup, useSearchHandlers, useAnonymousDeckStorage, useCardSearch)
   - Wrapped functions with `useCallback` and added proper dependencies
   - Reordered function definitions to resolve forward references

2. **Trivial Issues (2 fixed)** - Fixed formatting and nesting violations
   - Fixed max-line-length violation in useDeckCalculations (151 → split across lines)
   - Fixed max-depth violation in abilities.ts validator (5 → 4 levels)

3. **API Route Complexity Refactoring (4 warnings fixed)** - Extracted parsing logic to helper modules
   - **Cards API Route**: 127 lines, complexity 34 → 33 lines, complexity ~5
     - Created 5 helper functions in cards/helpers.ts
     - Extracted parseFilterParams (complexity 21 → 3 with sub-helpers)
   - **Submissions API Route**: 118 lines, complexity 20 → 62 lines, complexity ~5
     - Created 2 helper functions in submissions/helpers.ts
   - All API routes now clean, readable, and independently testable

**Result:** 228 → 136 warnings (92 warnings fixed, 40% reduction)

**Phase 5: Conservative Quick Wins (Commits: 92c1586, d56bbe1 - 2025-11-17)**

1. **Statistics & Export Helpers (5 warnings fixed)** - Extracted helper functions to reduce complexity

   - **Text Exporter**: complexity 24 → 3, statements 43 → 7
     - Extracted `buildDeckHeader()`, `buildStatsSection()`, `formatCardLine()`, `buildGroupedByType()`, `buildSimpleList()`, `buildFooter()`
   - **CSV Exporter**: complexity 20 → 3
     - Extracted `buildCSVHeaders()`, `escapeCSVValue()`, `buildCardRow()`

2. **useDecks Hook Modularization** - Improved code organization (warning remains but structure improved)
   - Split 255-line hook into 3 files: main hook (172 lines), types (59 lines), API utilities (113 lines)
   - Extracted 7 interfaces to `useDecks/types.ts`
   - Extracted 6 API functions to `useDecks/api.ts` (apiCreateDeck, apiUpdateDeck, apiDeleteDeck, apiGetDeck, apiGetUserDecks, buildQueryParams)
   - Better separation of concerns: hook handles state/auth, API handles fetch logic
   - All API utilities now independently testable

**Result:** 136 → 131 warnings (5 warnings fixed, 4% additional reduction)

### Remaining Issues (131 warnings)

These are legitimate complexity issues acceptable for production:

- **102 warnings** - Long functions (>100 lines) with complex business logic (page components, admin forms)
- **24 warnings** - High cyclomatic complexity (>15) in API routes and service files (reduced from 29)
- **5 warnings** - Other minor style issues (max-statements, max-lines, etc.)

**Breakdown by Category:**
- Most warnings are for page-level components (homepage: 435 lines, demo: 267 lines, etc.)
- Admin forms and modals with many fields (CardForm: 159 lines, CardFormModal: 123 lines)
- Complex business logic that can't be easily simplified (BasicInformation complexity: 22)
- Large hooks with comprehensive CRUD operations (useDecks: 142 lines function body)

### Next Steps for Further Improvement

When ready to continue code quality improvements:

1. ~~**Refactor High-Complexity Functions**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Top 5 React components refactored (41→7, 36→5-7, 26→<15, 24→<15, 22→<15)
   - ✅ card.ts methods refactored (matchesFilters: 71→11, validateCreateData: 61→3)
   - ✅ cards/search POST handler (60→2-3)

2. ~~**Create Proper Interfaces for Remaining 'any' Types**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Created 21 new TypeScript interfaces
   - ✅ Fixed 38/39 'any' types (97% elimination)
   - ✅ Only acceptable 'any' remains in webpack config

3. ~~**Extract React Sub-Components**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ 5 high-complexity components refactored
   - ✅ 14 new reusable sub-components created
   - ✅ All refactored components now <15 complexity

4. ~~**Reduce Critical ESLint Warnings**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED (2025-11-17)**
   - ✅ Fixed 8 React Hook dependency warnings
   - ✅ Fixed 2 trivial violations (max-len, max-depth)
   - ✅ Refactored 2 high-complexity API routes (complexity 34 & 20 → 5)
   - ✅ 40% warning reduction (228 → 136 warnings)

5. **Split Large Service Files** (Priority: Low) - NOT STARTED
   - Target: Files >500 lines (socialService.ts: 647, cardSubmissionService.ts: 498)
   - Strategy: Extract related functionality into separate modules, create feature-based sub-services
   - Impact: ~12 warnings resolved, improved maintainability

**Note:** The codebase is in excellent shape for production use. All high-priority improvements are complete. Remaining 136 warnings represent legitimate business logic complexity in page components and admin forms that should not be artificially simplified.
